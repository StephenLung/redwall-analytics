<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In late May, Redwall visited its favorite family beach vacation spot, and was thinking that it was so nice, it would be fun go back again in August. We would like to know all of the available choices for the week without having to scroll through incomplete realty websites. Maybe we would also like to monitor availability and prices on an ongoing basis going forward. Now that we are all set up with Python via <code>reticulate</code>, this seems like an opportunity to add a few new skills.</p>
<p>When we started this mini-project, we hoped to use <code>datatable</code> as our main data frame in conjunction with the Python libraries like <code>BeautifulSoup</code> and data structures not available in R, like dictionaries. We soon learned that <code>datatable</code> doesn’t support dates yet. In <a href="https://redwallanalytics.com/2020/05/07/exploring-big-mt-cars-with-python-datatable-and-plotnine-part-1/">Exploring Big MT Cars with Python datatable-Part 1</a>, we noted that <code>datatable</code> is still in alpha stage, and worked around the lack of reshaping capability and the inability to pipe our data directly into plots, but this really a deal breaker for this project. As a result, though we were able to keep using <code>plotnine</code>, we were finally forced to get better with <code>pandas</code>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import itertools
import plotnine as p9
from mizani.breaks import date_breaks
from mizani.formatters import date_format
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import re
import time
import json as JSON
import pickle
import datetime
import pprint</code></pre>

<div id="scraping-process" class="section level1">
<h1>Scraping Process</h1>
<p>We found www.vacationrentalslbi.com has an extensive list of rentals on the island, and doesn’t restrict to the particular agency maintaining the listing, so this is the perfect place to gather our data. Naturally, we would like to be polite, so check that we are allowed to scrape. We can see from the R <code>robotstxt</code> library, which indicates that <code>paths_allowed</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, that we are good to go with our intended link.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Robots.txt says okay to scrape
robotstxt::paths_allowed(&#39;https://www.vacationrentalslbi.com/search/for.rent/sleeps_min.4/&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>Scraping the website for listings is a two-step process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>go through and extract the links to all of the listings</li>
<li>navigate back to all of the links and extract the listing details</li>
</ol>
<p>We set our requests to the website to vary at an average 5-second delay, and build a list of the ‘href’ links from the returned ‘a’ tags. We are not running our scraping code now for the blog post, but the results is shown in the link below loaded from disc.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Extract links for min sleep of 4 from vacationrentalslbi.com website
links = []
for i in range(0, 1250, 25):
  if i == 0:
     url = &#39;https://www.vacationrentalslbi.com/search/for.rent/sleeps_min.4/&#39;
  else:
      url = &#39;https://www.vacationrentalslbi.com/search/for.rent/sleeps_min.4/&#39; + str(i)
  html_content = requests.get(url).text
  
  # Parse the html content
  soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, &#39;lxml&#39;)
  time.sleep(5)
  links.append([link[&#39;href&#39;] for link in soup.find_all(&#39;a&#39;, href=True) if &#39;listing.&#39; in link[&#39;href&#39;]])
  
# Extract links
links = list(set(itertools.chain(*links)))
listings = [link for link in links if not &#39;#&#39; in link]</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code># Load pre-scraped listing links from disc
path = &#39;/Volumes/davidlucey/aDL/data/lbi/&#39;
file = &#39;listings.txt&#39;
# Pickle load listings

<div id="get-listings-from-home" class="section level1">
<h1>Get Listings from Home</h1>
<p>Now, we build a second scraper to take the list of listings, extract the key elements of each and return a dictionary which we store in a list. We won’t go into detail here, but the way to find the desired classes is to navigate to the vacationrentalslbi.com on Google Chrome, select Ctrl-Alt-I, choose the ‘Select Element’ option in the ‘Elements’ pane, and then navigate to the desired spot on the page. We selected the title, content, description, location, and calendar sub-element tables for ‘booked’ and ‘available’ from the ‘month_box’. It took some work to get the calendar. We then returned a dictionary with all of these elements from our <code>get_dict</code> function.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Function to take listing, scrape and return key elements as dictionary
def get_dict(listing):
  
  # Extract html text
  html_content = requests.get(listing).text
  # Parse the html content
  soup1 = BeautifulSoup(html_content)

  # Title and attributes
  title = soup1.find_all(&quot;div&quot;, class_= &quot;col-md-3 title&quot;)
  title = [item.text for item in title]
  content = soup1.find_all(&quot;div&quot;, class_= &quot;col-md-9 content&quot;)
  content = [item.text for item in content]
  d = {title[i]: content[i] for i in range(len(title))} 

  # Description and location
  try:
    description = soup1.find(&quot;p&quot;).get_text()
  except: 
    description = None
  d[&#39;description&#39;] = description
  try:
    location = soup1.find(&quot;div&quot;, attrs={&quot;class&quot; : &quot;ld_location&quot;}).get_text()
  except:
    location = None
  d[&#39;location&#39;] = location

  # Extract full calendar
  availability = soup1.find_all(&quot;div&quot;, class_ = &quot;month_box col-sm-4 col-xs-12&quot;)
  table_rows = [item.table for item in availability]

  # Extract booked
  l = []
  for tr in table_rows:
    td = tr.find_all(&#39;td&#39;, class_ = &quot;booked&quot;)
    rows = [tr.text for tr in td if tr]
    for row in rows:
      if row != &#39;&#39;:
          rows.remove(row)
      l.append(rows)
  l = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(l))
  df1 = pd.DataFrame(l)
  df1[&quot;status&quot;] = &quot;booked&quot;

  # Extract available
  l = []
  for tr in table_rows:
    td = tr.find_all(&#39;td&#39;, class_ = &quot;available&quot;)
    rows = [tr.text for tr in td if tr]
    for row in rows:
      if row != &#39;&#39;:
          rows.remove(row)
      l.append(rows)
  l = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(l))
  df = pd.DataFrame(l)
  df[&quot;status&quot;] = &quot;available&quot;

  # Combine &#39;booked&#39; and &#39;available&#39; in calendar
  calendar = pd.concat(list([df,df1]))
  calendar[[&quot;start_day&quot;,&quot;start_date&quot;,&quot;hyphen&quot;, &quot;end_date&quot;,&quot;period&quot;]] = calendar[0].str.split(expand=True)
  calendar[[&quot;end_date&quot;, &quot;rate&quot;]] = calendar[&quot;end_date&quot;].str.split(&quot;$&quot;, expand=True)
  
  # Clean up
  del calendar[&#39;hyphen&#39;]
  del calendar[&#39;start_day&#39;]
  del calendar[0]
  calendar = calendar.drop_duplicates()
  
  # Convert to dictionary for return
  d[&#39;calendar&#39;] = calendar.to_dict()
  return d</code></pre>
<p>When an element of a listing is not present, we were having breaks, so we put in exception handling for those cases. Although we think we have handled most of the likely errors in get_dict, the full scraping process takes a couple of hours, so we thought best to save to disc after each request. It took us a while how to figure this out, because it turns out not to be so straight-forward to save and append a json to disc. We were able to write to disc as txt as we do in <code>append_record</code> below.</p>
</div>
<div id="scrape-all-listings" class="section level1">
<h1>Scrape All Listings</h1>
<p>With our <code>get_dict</code> function, we scrape each listing, create a dictionary entry and append it to disc with <code>append_record</code>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Loop through listings with get_dict and add to Google Drive
for listing in listings:
  
  # Initiate dictionaries
  entry = {}
  details = {}
  
  # Extract listing details with `get_dict` function above
  try:
    details = get_dict(listing)
  except:
    details = None
  
  # Take break
  time.sleep(5)
  
  # Get `listing_id` to add as dictionary key
  listing_id = re.findall(&#39;\d+&#39;, listing)[0]
  
  # Create dictionary `entry`
  # Then append to lbi.txt file on disc with `append_record` function above
  entry = {listing_id:  details }
  try:
    append_record(entry)
  except:
    print(listing_id + &#39; Failed&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Again, we wanted to avoid re-running the code, we are showing our saved data from disc. We load the saved data from our text file as a list of 1231 Python dictionaries. The dictionary for a sample listing of ‘464’ is shown in the chunk below. The attributes of the listing are deeply nested and not easy to filter and sort. However, we learned that it is easy to extract the desired elements using the dictionary keys, which we do in the <code>get_calendar</code> function below.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Load lbi.txt back into notebook as list of dictionaries
filename = &#39;lbi.txt&#39;
with open(path + filename) as fh: 
  lbi = [JSON.loads(line) for line in fh]

# Show listing &#39;464&#39; dictionary
pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(depth=4)
pp.pprint(lbi[0])</code></pre>

<h1>Parse Listings</h1>
<p>Using <code>get_calendar</code>, we extract the dictionary key for the listing, and then the value desired value elements including ‘rate’, ‘start_date’, ‘end_date’, ‘location’, ‘location_type’ and ‘beds’. We have to clean and transform the ‘rate’ variable to <code>float</code> and the date fields to <code>datetime</code>, and in our case, we are looking for the first two weeks of August, so we filter for just those two weeks. We also add the url back in so it is easy to take a look at an interesting listing in more detail. We also manufactured some variables for our graphs below. For example, we generated a ‘month-year’ variable so we could aggregate weekly average prices and number of homes available. There were too many different sleep capacities, so we aggregated into just four levels (sleeps 4 or under, 8 or under, 12 or under and more than 12). Beach Haven has 7-8 separate small sections, so we changed to just one.</p>

<h1>Location Inflation</h1>
<p>We had hoped to segment and consider the prices for Oceanside, Ocean block, Bayside block and Bayfront, but landlords interpret the meaning of “Oceanside” liberally. We tend to think of that term as looking at the water from your deck, but ~60% of rentals are designated in this category, when true “Oceanside” can’t be more than 10%. In most cases, landlords probably mean Ocean block, but there is not a lot we can do to pick this apart. We also don’t have the exact addresses, so we are probably out of luck to find anything useful in this regard.</p>

<h1>Biggest Rental Towns by Volume</h1>
<p>By far the most rental action is in the Beach Haven sections in July and August (shown in orange), but those sections also have more year-round availability than the the other towns. If the plan is to go with less than 8 people, there is not a lot of options. In fact, it was surprising to see that there was more available in the largest sleeps &gt;12 than the family of four category. As mentioned in our previous post about <code>plotnine</code>, the lack of support for <code>plotly</code> hovering is a bit of a detraction here, because it can be hard to tell which color denotes which city. This might mean we have to learn <code>seaborn</code> in the future, just as we have been forced to learn <code>pandas</code> for this post.</p>

<h1>Availability vs Booked by City</h1>
<p>Beach Haven has more B&amp;B’s and some of the only hotels on the Island, so smaller size properties on average and somewhat less consistent visitors. More rentals outside of Beach Haven are probably renewed annually, so it might be more impacted by delayed plans due to COVID-19 than other towns. Coupled with it being about as big as all the other towns put together, this may help explain why also shows a lot more relatively more red at this stage.</p>

<h1>Prices for Booked Properties Peaking in July</h1>
<p>2020 might not be a typical year with the uncertainty around COVID-19, but the fall off in prices starting in August, when there appears to be more supply, is shown here. Landlords may have pulled supply for July when things looked uncertain and then put it back on at the last minute. It also looks like the available properties might be in that category, because they are priced higher than comparable properties. At least for the bigger properties, the posted prices of available properties are clearly higher than for the booked ones. Let’s face it, if you haven’t booked your property sleeping more than 8 by now, it might be tough for most groups of that size to organize at this late stage.</p>

<h1>Homegenous Prices Across Cities</h1>
<p>For anyone who has been to LBI, it is pretty much nice everywhere. Accept for maybe Loveladies, there aren’t really premium towns in the sense of the NYC suburbs. Loveladies shown in light blue can be seen towards the higher end, but still among the pack. The main distinction is if the house is beachfront or not, but unfortunately, we don’t have a good source of that data at this stage. The rents for the largest homes does show quite a bit more divergence among towns than the other three categories.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Most families are constrained to July and early August, but for those with the freedom to go at other times, there is a lot of opportunity to have a great vacation at an affordable price! We also know that vacationrentalslbi.com also operates sites for Wildwood, North Wildwood, Wildwood Crest and Diamond Beach, so it our scraper would probably work the same for all of those. Now that we have the code, we can parse listings whenever considering a vacation at the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>We will be learning NLP with Python next week, so a follow up might be made to try to find attributes from the “description” tag from our dictionary. We may also do a future post on how to schedule automatic weekly scraping, then storing parsed data to a database for each property. The field of analytics is still in its early stages, and there is much discussion about which tools will be necessary and will survive the test of time. Redwall continues to believe that the time is now to become data literate and to learn scripting languages like Python and R because they offer access to information which just wouldn’t be available using higher level tools like Excel, Tableau or Power BI.</p>
